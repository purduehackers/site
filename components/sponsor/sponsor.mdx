Founded in 2013, Purdue Hackers is an organization of students who ship creative technical projects and build marketable skills. We're the largest computer science organization at Purdue University, a top 20 CS program.

We‚Äôve partnered with companies like Facebook, Bloomberg, Cloudflare, and Vercel, as well as run [an AMA with Steve Wozniak](https://events.purduehackers.com/events/special/ama-steve-wozniak).

# The Problem

University recruiting is a frustratingly low-ROI venture. Companies and students come to career fairs to form personal connections, but the flood of students prevents interactions from being deep, making it difficult for both parties to filter for their best matches.

Meanwhile, CS and Engineering students struggle to build extracurricular projects, even though they know doing so is the best way to build real technical skills and stand out as applicants. Building a project is hard: students need to find the right idea, set aside time to get started, and see it through, all while juggling academic and social obligations.

Career fairs don't effectively filter for the best candidates, and students struggle to build the projects that help them stand out. Purdue Hackers facilitates technical projects, creating and naturally filtering for talented engineers.

# The Solution: Purdue Hackers üíõ‚ö° 

**Purdue Hackers is a community for building technical projects**, like apps, websites, digital art, robotics, and microelectronics. Our members‚Äî‚Äúhackers‚Äù‚Äîform groups and make weird, wacky, and creative things together. An average hacker starts a project at one of our hour-long workshops, builds it with friends at one of our weekly Hack Nights, and ships it at the Show.

Many hackers make their closest friends within Purdue Hackers, who push them on projects and consistently raise their ambitions. This rigor inspires everyone to make projects that challenge their abilities, including beginners.

All our events are opt-in, and hackers only work on extracurricular projects they deeply care about. This brings them to Purdue Hackers out of genuine passion instead of obligation, which enables them to spend more time on their projects and grow tremendously.

**The result is an extraordinarily high concentration of talented and motivated engineers.** Hackers have worked at companies like Apple, Google, Figma, and Vercel, and they've founded YC-backed startups like [Pylon](https://usepylon.com/) and [Exla](https://exla.ai/).

## Sponsorship Packages

Join us this December for our second annual end-of-semester Show, where students showcase their incredible projects to hundreds of attendees. Our sponsorship tiers provide benefits across all Purdue Hackers programs throughout the semester.

[The Fall 2024 Show](https://burst.purduehackers.com/) took place in Purdue's Rueff Galleries on Sunday, December 8th from 2-6pm. The event saw 250 attendees, and projects showcased included a meter-tall LED sign, an alien/boba-themed video game, and our club's NFC-enabled passports.

## Individual Program Sponsorship

For companies seeking targeted engagement with specific programs, we also offer specialized sponsorship options:

### Hack Night

![A long shot of a different section of the same makerspace. Every seat is filled with people working.](/img/sponsor/hack-night-2.jpg)

</Grid>

A mini hackathon every Friday night at the local makerspace, with 80 attendees on average. Students have uninterrupted time to work on creative projects with friends‚Äîincluding [a meter-tall sign powered by a custom PCB](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/sign), an alternative time system, (ethical) iOS exploits, and [a fully functional Rubik's cube computer](https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/qter). Hack Night ends very late at night, often at 6:00am.

</Grid>

Workshops are hour-long sessions that introduce attendees to new concepts, like [generative art](https://events.purduehackers.com/events/workshops/generative-art), [shaders](https://events.purduehackers.com/events/workshops/shaders/2022), [word embeddings](https://events.purduehackers.com/events/workshops/word-embedding), and [interpreters](https://events.purduehackers.com/events/workshops/interpreters/2024). Everyone leaves with a finished project that they can continue working on.

Tech talks are workshop-flavored events, but for sponsors to talk about something you want to get in front of students. The talk can be technical, about your product or company, a recruiting event, or all of the above. You control the content, we get it in front of students.

Attendance for workshops and tech talks ranges from 50 to 150.
