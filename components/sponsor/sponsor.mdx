Founded in 2013, Purdue Hackers is an organization of students who ship creative technical projects & build marketable skills. We're the largest computer science organization at Purdue University, a top 20 CS program.

# The Problem

University recruiting is a frustratingly low-ROI venture. Companies and students come to career fairs to form personal connections, but the flood of students prevents interactions from being deep, making it difficult for both parties to filter for their best matches.

Meanwhile, CS & Engineering students struggle to build extracurricular projects, even though they know doing so is the best way to build real technical skills & stand out as applicants. Building a project is hard: they need to find the right idea, set aside time to get started, and see it through, all while juggling academic & social obligations.

Career fairs don't effectively filter for the best candidates, and students struggle to build the projects that help them stand out. Purdue Hackers facilitates technical projects, creating & naturally filtering for talented engineers.

# The Solution: Purdue Hackers 💛⚡

**Purdue Hackers is a community for building technical projects**, like apps, websites, digital art, robotics, and microelectronics. Our members—“hackers”—form groups & make weird, wacky, & creative things together. An average hacker starts a project at one of our hour-long workshops, builds it with friends at one of our weekly Hack Nights, and ships it at the Show.

Many hackers make their closest friends within Purdue Hackers, who push them on projects & consistently raise their ambitions. This rigor inspires everyone to make projects that challenge their abilities, including beginners.

All our events are opt-in, and hackers only work on extracurricular projects they deeply care about. This brings them to Purdue Hackers out of genuine passion instead of obligation, which enables them to spend more time on their projects & grow tremendously.

**The result is an extraordinarily high concentration of talented & motivated engineers.** Hackers have interned & worked at highly-respected companies like Apple, Google, Figma, & Vercel, and started their own companies.

# Where You Come In

Purdue Hackers runs three core programs: workshops & tech talks, Hack Night, and the Show. We want to partner with you on one of these programs, through which you will gain direct recruiting access to our members.

## Hack Night

<Grid>

![A long shot of a different section of the same makerspace. Every seat is filled with people working.](/img/sponsor/hack-night-2.jpg)

</Grid>

A mini hackathon every Friday night at the local makerspace, with 80 attendees on average. Students have uninterrupted time to work on creative projects with friends—including [an alternative time system](https://lightning-time.vercel.app/), a meter-tall sign powered by a custom PCB, a camera-based drawing website, (ethical) iOS exploits, and [an entire computing stack made from NAND gates](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40159278). Hack Night ends very late at night, often as late as 6:00am.

## Workshops and Tech Talks

</Grid>

Workshops are hour-long sessions that introduce attendees to new concepts, like [generative art](https://events.purduehackers.com/generative-art-workshop), [shaders](https://events.purduehackers.com/shaders-workshop), [word embeddings](https://events.purduehackers.com/word-embedding-workshop), and [interpreters](https://events.purduehackers.com/programming-languages-workshop). Everyone leaves with a finished project that they can continue working on.

Tech talks are workshop-flavored events, but for sponsors to talk about something you want to get in front of students. The talk can be technical, about your product, about your company, or all of the above. You control the content, we get it in front of students.

Attendance for workshops and tech talks ranges from 50 to 150.

An event at the end of every semester for students to present what they’ve worked on at Hack Night to 300+ attendees, featuring projects like the Sign (pictured), a Rubik’s cube computer, laser tag in VR, research projects, and more.

The Fall 2024 Show is taking place in the Rueff Galleries on campus, on Sunday, December 8th from 2-6pm.

## Custom

If none of the other options resonate with you, or you want some combination of the above tiers, we have run entirely custom events with sponsors in the past ([example: HammerWars](https://events.purduehackers.com/-hammerwars-)), and we would like to discuss what a version of this could look like with you.

<Grid className="my-2" largeGap overflow singleRow>

<Tier
  title="Partner"
  price={10000}
  description={`Cover our annual budget & become an official Partner. “Sponsored by [your company]” on our website & all our marketing materials. Gain access to all our events for an entire school year.`}

<Tier
  title="Custom"
  description={`Partner with us on a custom event of your choice. “Cohosted by [your company]” on all marketing materials. Direct access to all attendees. Full control over event content & schedule.`}
/>

</Grid>

**All tiers and prices are negotiable.** If you don't see your ideal partnership, we'd be happy to find it with you.
