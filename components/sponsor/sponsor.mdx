University recruiting is broken. Career fairs are supposed to build real connections, but the flood of students makes meaningful filtering nearly impossible. At the same time, students struggle to build the ambitious technical projects that actually set them apart.

That’s where Purdue Hackers steps in.

Founded in 2013, Purdue Hackers is a community of engineers, designers, and tinkerers at Purdue University who build things together. We’ve grown into the largest computer science organization on campus – in one of the nation’s top CS programs – united by a simple idea: the most meaningful technical work happens when people are free to build what they love and surrounded by a supportive community.

Every Friday night, 80+ students gather for Hack Night. There are no prompts, no prizes, no hackathon noise. Just time, space, and a concentrated atmosphere of people working on projects that matter to them. Some spend the night debugging custom PCBs. Others write compilers, experiment with iOS exploits, or design new computing systems from scratch. Hack Night starts at 8 PM and often ends at dawn.

This culture of deep work has created an exceptional density of talent. Our members have built startups and engineered at Vercel, Figma, Apple, AWS, and Google. Three past presidents are Y Combinator founders, and several members have taken gap years to build their startups in recent YC batches. This semester alone, we’ve hosted SpaceX, Kleiner Perkins, and Neuralink – whose co-founder flew out for a 200-person meet and greet.

This is what happens when ambitious students have the right environment: they build extraordinary things, and they become extraordinary engineers.

# Where You Come In

Purdue Hackers runs on a shoestring budget to support a community that punches far above its weight. This year alone, we’ve allocated thousands of dollars in microgrants and resources to help students ship their projects – unlocking bigger ideas and more ambitious work than ever before.

We want to keep raising the ceiling. Your support directly funds the work that makes this community special:

<div className="pl-2 md:pl-8 text-left">
- Microgrants for students building ambitious technical projects.
- Hack Night, the weekly heartbeat of our community.
- The Show, our annual showcase of student projects.
- Materials & infrastructure that make all this wonderful engineering possible.
</div>

Most of our supporters contribute between $500 - $5,000 per year. We don’t do rigid sponsorship tiers, we build lightweight, high-leverage partnerships. In return, we highlight your company in our community, make it easy for your team to connect directly with the builders behind the work (with tech talks, direct recruiting, and more),  and feature your logo on event marketing and website.

By supporting Purdue Hackers, you’re embedding your company directly into the center of the most ambitious technical community at Purdue. Our sponsors don’t stand on the sidelines; they’re in the room where great projects are born. You get early access to world-class student talent long before they hit career fairs, your brand sits alongside the most inspiring work on campus, and your team gets to meet and recruit builders in their natural habitat – not through a cold inbox.

## The Show

Every semester ends with *The Show*, the largest creative-technical demo day in the Midwest. It’s where our members unveil the projects they’ve spent months building: time sculptures, kinetic installations, generative art, custom hardware, and other work that blends engineering with creativity. Hundreds of students, faculty, and industry guests pack the space to see what’s possible when talented people are given time and freedom to build.

For sponsors, The Show isn’t just another event – it’s a front-row seat to the most ambitious student builders in Purdue Hackers. It’s where your company stands shoulder-to-shoulder with their work, in front of hundreds of students, faculty, and industry guests. Your brand becomes part of the story – visible on every banner, every program, every moment people remember. It’s also a uniquely high-leverage way to connect with the kind of talent that doesn’t wait for permission to build. This year’s Show, [spill ≋](https://spill.purduehackers.com/), is happening December 6th.
